A book store stocks a number of book titles. The provided file Books.txt gives the details 
of the inventory, one book per line, giving the ISBN, price and current stock amount. 
Transactions for the inventory system are provided in the file Transactions.txt. Two 
types of transactions have to be handled by the inventory system:

- STOCK transactions, which specifies the ISBN of a book, and the number of copies of that 
book to be added to stock.

- ORDER transactions, each of which specifies the ISBN of the book being ordered, the 
number of copies of the book requested by the customer, and a 6-digit customer number.

If an order cannot be filled completely because of insufficient stock, the unfilled part 
of the order (the entire order if there is zero stock) must be placed on a queue of back 
orders for that book.

When new stock is received for a book, the inventory system must work through the back 
order queue for that book, filling as many back orders as it can. If a back order can 
only be partly filled before the stock level of the book drops to zero, the unfilled 
remainder of that back order must remain at the head of the back order queue for that book.

You must use the provided queue type (Queue.java) for your back order queues.
