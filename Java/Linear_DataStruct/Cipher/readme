Answers:

GridWriter: where the second argument is the correct grid length to crack code

1 2 cipher0.txt 
1 5 cipher1.txt
1 11 cipher2.txt
1 4 cipher3.txt
1 6 cipher4.txt

GridEncrypt: converting the plain text to the cipher version

2 plain0.txt    -> cipher0.txt
5 plain1.txt    -> cipher1.txt
11 plain2.txt   -> cipher2.txt
4 plain3.txt    -> cipher3.txt
6 plain4.txt    -> cipher4.txt
