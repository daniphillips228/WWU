The input file will consist of two lines.  

The first line consists of a single positive integer giving the 
value of MinInterval.   

The second line consists of a sequence of positive integers giving the 
value of the truffles at positions 0 through M, which can be 0, indicating 
that truffle has been deposited.  

The output will consist of the positions of the nuggets that maximize 
the value of your takings, the values at each position, and the total 
value of your takings.  

For example, if the input file contains the following:
4 
1 4 3 2 9 8 7 6 
The optimal subsequence is 4 + 8 = 12, derived from positions 1 and 5 
(assuming that position numberings starts at 0). 

Were MinIndex in this case 2, the optimal answer would be 4 + 9 + 7 = 20 
derived from positions 1, 4, 6.
