The input file will represent the number of truffles to be found along 
the path from one grid and another.  

The input file will simply consist of positive integers, underline scores, 
embraced within parentheses, thus:

(3 1)(2 0)(4 2)(0 4)(_ 3)
(3 4)(2 6)(4 5)(2 2)(_ 1)
(0 4)(7 4)(3 5)(4 2)(_ 1)
(3 5)(3 6)(0 8)(2 5)(_ 3)
(1 _)(3 _)(2 _)(2 _)(_ _)

The file is to be interpreted in this way:

1. The first pair in the file represents the upper right-hand corner of the grid.  
The first number in a pair tells you how many truffles can be retrieved by the next 
square to the right. The second number tells you how many truffles can be retrieved 
by going to the grid location immediately below.

2. An underscore in the left position of a pair tells you that you cannot go further 
to the right.

3. An underscore in the right position of a pair tells you that you cannot traverse 
further down. 

By tradition, truffle hunters are permitted only one path through the grid, 
starting at the upper left and terminating at the lower right.  That is, one 
may pick up all the truffles in a given square of the grid but one may only traverse 
to the right or down, never diagonally, left or up.

The output will be :
(1) a sequence of grid positions traversed in a path 
that maximizes the total number of truffles harvested
(2) the total number of truffles collectable along that path.
