1. For each company, identify the crazy days in terms of stock price fluctuation. 
Here is how to calculate the crazy days. Suppose at Date D, the high price of the share 
of company X is Hx and Low price is Lx. Then D will be called crazy day if (Hx-Lx)/Hx >= 15%

2. For each company, identify stock splits, we will use the following definition:
Cx is the closing price on day x and O(x+1) is the opening price on the next trading day 
x + 1.

Definitions:
A 2:1 stock split occurs if | Cx / O(x+1) – 2.0| < 0.05
A 3:1 stock split occurs if | Cx / O(x+1) – 3.0| < 0.05
A 3:2 stock split occurs if | Cx / O(x+1) – 1.5| < 0.05
