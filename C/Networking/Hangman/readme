Client and server for a simple (hangman-like) letter guessing game. When the server 
is started, it is given a “secret” word (a string of characters in the set {a,b,...,z}). 
Initially, the client has as many guesses as there are characters in the secret word. If 
a client makes an incorrect guess, the number of guesses left is decremented by one. If a 
client makes a correct guess, the number of guesses left is unchanged and all instances 
of that letter are filled in on the board. The interaction continues until the client 
guesses all of the letters in the word (and thus wins), or runs out guesses and loses.

Command-Line Specification:

The server should take exactly two command-line arguments:

1. The port on which the server will run, a 16-bit unsigned integer
2. The word that the client must guess, a string of between 1 and 254 lower case letters

The client should take exactly two command-line arguments:

1. The address of the server (e.g. a 32 bit integer in dotted-decimal notation) 
2. The port on which the server is running, a 16-bit unsigned integer

Compilation:
gcc -o hangman_server hangman_server.c
gcc -o hangman_client hangman_client.c

An example command to start the server is:
./hangman_server 36799 binary

An example command to run the client is:
./hangman_client 127.0.0.1 36799
